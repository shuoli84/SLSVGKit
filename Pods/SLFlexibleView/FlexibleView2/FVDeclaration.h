* This class stands for one view, though just its declaration. It holds the position, size information and also

*
*         [[FVDeclaration declaration:@"NavigationBar" frame:CGRectMake(0, 0, FVP(1), 44)] withDeclarations:@[
*             [FVDeclaration declaration:@"MenuButton" frame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 44, FVP(1))],
*             [FVDeclaration declaration:@"ComposeButton" frame:CGRectMake(FVT(44), 0, 44, FVP(1))], ]]
*
* Above code create a navigation bar with 2 buttons, menu button stands on left with width 44. Compose button on right
*     FVP(1) : percentage 100%
*     FVT(44) : count from tail by 44 points
*     FVR(20) : count from the prev view's same attribute, x for x, y for y, and then plus 20
*     FVA(20) : follows the prev view, and then plus 20
*     FVAuto : auto calculate the width or height to just contain all subviews.  **
*
* @warning *note* prev view only counts in the siblings in the same parent.
* @warning *important* **when use auto, all its subviews' related frame attributes must be able to calculated without
* this loadView's info, otherwise, a dependency loop detected and error return
